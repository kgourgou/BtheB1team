\section{Background}
This is a dataset containing information from a clinical trial with "Beat the Blues", an interactive
multimedia program of cognitive-behavioural techniques. Since there are way more patients suffering from anxiety
and depression than therapists, the study of the dataset makes the case that this program can indeed help with
the treatment. One of the metrics used to gauge depression levels was BDI or Beck Depression Inventory.

The dataset contains one hundred observations of one hundred patients and eight variables.
BDI was tracked before treatment, after two months and then after one, three and six month follow-ups.
Two groups are studied, one that uses the BtB program and one that has the usual anti-depression treatment.
Those can be further splitted to sub-groups of patients that were taking anti-depressant drugs.

\section{Variables and Hypothesis}

The variables we chose to work with were bdi.2m and bdi.3m, which were the Beck Depression Inventory II test results of the 100 patients after two months and after three months, respectively.
\newline
\newline
The following summarizes the two variables of interest for the usual treatment group and the beat the blues group:

<<echo=FALSE>>=
# Multiplot Function
multiplot <- function(..., plotlist=NULL, file, cols=1, layout=NULL) {
  require(grid)

  # Make a list from the ... arguments and plotlist
  plots <- c(list(...), plotlist)

  numPlots = length(plots)

  # If layout is NULL, then use 'cols' to determine layout
  if (is.null(layout)) {
    # Make the panel
    # ncol: Number of columns of plots
    # nrow: Number of rows needed, calculated from # of cols
    layout <- matrix(seq(1, cols * ceiling(numPlots/cols)),
                    ncol = cols, nrow = ceiling(numPlots/cols))
  }

 if (numPlots==1) {
    print(plots[[1]])

  } else {
    # Set up the page
    grid.newpage()
    pushViewport(viewport(layout = grid.layout(nrow(layout), ncol(layout))))

    # Make each plot, in the correct location
    for (i in 1:numPlots) {
      # Get the i,j matrix positions of the regions that contain this subplot
      matchidx <- as.data.frame(which(layout == i, arr.ind = TRUE))

      print(plots[[i]], vp = viewport(layout.pos.row = matchidx$row,
                                      layout.pos.col = matchidx$col))
    }
  }
}

m3<-rbind(sum(is.na(BtheB$bdi.3m) & BtheB$treatment=="TAU"),sum(is.na(BtheB$bdi.3m) & BtheB$treatment=="BtheB"), sum(is.na(BtheB$bdi.3m) & BtheB$treatment=="TAU") +sum(is.na(BtheB$bdi.3m) & BtheB$treatment=="BtheB"))

The 3 that are missing from the m2 data are also missing from the m3 data, so we have 73 useuable observations.  Of these 73 we have a close number for each treament; 36 had the treatment TAU and 37 had the treatment, "BtheB".  It's nice that we have a almost even number of participants in each group.  Though the sample size seems too small, it is far better than if we had used either of the last 2 variables.
