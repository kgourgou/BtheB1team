BtheB Group 1 Write-up
========================================================

**TODO** : Our names will go here (?)

## Introduction

This is a dataset containing information from a clinical trial with "Beat the Blues", an interactive
multimedia program of cognitive-behavioural techniques. Since there are way more patients suffering from anxiety
and depression than therapists, the study of the dataset makes the case that this program can indeed help with
the treatment. One of the metrics used to gauge depression levels was BDI or Beck Depression Inventory.

The dataset contains one hundred observations of one hundred patients and eight variables.
BDI was tracked before treatment, after two months and then after one, three and six month follow-ups.
Two groups are studied, one that uses the BtB program and one that has the usual anti-depression treatment.
Those can be further splitted to sub-groups of patients that were taking anti-depressant drugs.


**TODO** : Do you think anything else should be added? Perhaps what's the main point in our report,
i.e the variables we compare.


**TODO** : Citation is needed (perhaps with knitcitations?)
This data frame comes from the following study.

*J. Proudfoot, D. Goldberg, A. Mann, B. S. Everitt, I. Marks and J. A. Gray, (2003). Computerized, interactive, multimedia cognitive-behavioural program for anxiety and depression in general practice. Psychological Medicine, 33(2), 217â€“227.*


## Variables

The variables we chose to work with were bdi.2m and bdi.3m, which were the Beck Depression Inventory II test results of the 100 patients after two months and after three months, respectively.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(MASS)
library(HSAUR2)

BtheB <- BtheB
attach(BtheB)
```
The following summarizes all 8 variables and displays side-by-side boxplots of the two variables bdi.2m and bdi.3m.
```{r}
summary(BtheB)
boxplot(bdi.2m, bdi.3m)
```
As displayed in the boxplots, the median score on the BDI test at the two month follow-up was slightly higher than that at the three month follow-up.

## On missing values
```{r}
m2<-rbind(sum(is.na(BtheB$bdi.2m) & BtheB$treatment=="BtheB"), sum(is.na(BtheB$bdi.2m) & BtheB$treatment=="TAU") +sum(is.na(BtheB$bdi.2m) & BtheB$treatment=="BtheB"))
m3<-rbind(sum(is.na(BtheB$bdi.3m) & BtheB$treatment=="TAU"),sum(is.na(BtheB$bdi.3m) & BtheB$treatment=="BtheB"), sum(is.na(BtheB$bdi.3m) & BtheB$treatment=="TAU") +sum(is.na(BtheB$bdi.3m) & BtheB$treatment=="BtheB"))
m4<-rbind(sum(is.na(BtheB$bdi.3m) & is.na(BtheB$bdi.2m) & BtheB$treatment=="TAU"),sum(is.na(BtheB$bdi.3m) & is.na(BtheB$bdi.2m) & BtheB$treatment=="BtheB"),sum(is.na(BtheB$bdi.3m) & is.na(BtheB$bdi.2m) & BtheB$treatment=="BtheB")+sum(is.na(BtheB$bdi.3m) & is.na(BtheB$bdi.2m) & BtheB$treatment=="TAU") )
missing<-cbind(m2,m3,m4)
col<-c("bdi.2m", "bdi.3m", "Both")
row<-c("TAU", "BtheB", "Total")
row.names(missing)<-row
colnames(missing)<-col
missing

100-27

sum(BtheB$treatment=="TAU")-missing[1,2]
sum(BtheB$treatment=="BtheB")-missing[2,2]

```
The 3 that are missing from the m2 data are also missing from the m3 data, so we have 73 useuable observations. Of these 73 we have a close number for each treament; 36 had the treatment TAU and 37 had the treatment, "BtheB". It's nice that we have a almost even number of participants in each group. Though the sample size seems too small, it is far better than if we had used either of the last 2 variables.


## Analysis (STILL NEEDS WORK!)
```{r}
plot(bdi.3m~bdi.2m)
m2m3m <- lm(bdi.3m~bdi.2m,data=BtheB)
abline(m2m3m)
summary(m2m3m)

qplot(bdi.2m, bdi.3m, data = BtheB, facets = . ~ treatment,geom=c("point","smooth"), method="lm")
```
